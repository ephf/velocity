# Velocity Language

> latest revision: v0.1.0 (unstable)

```sh
make vlc
```

TypeScript development time with C runtime

First version is currently being written in c, the language will look similar to Rust and TypeScript with lower-level abilities seen in C and C++

If you want to read code, go to [/src/parse/](/src/parse/) or [/src/main.c](/src/main.c), code outside of this is spaghetti.

See how to use the language in [/language.md](/language.md).
